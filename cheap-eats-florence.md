title: Cheap Eats in Florence
---

Florence can be expensive in the centre — but some of the most local food is, by nature, cheap. This page shows you how to eat well on a budget without settling for tourist rubbish.

## How to eat cheaply (and still eat well)

- Don’t “do restaurants” for every meal: use **markets, bakeries, panini shops, and street food**
- Treat **aperitivo** as dinner when the bites are good
- Avoid “cheap” menus in the postcard zone — worst value, biggest regret

## Cheap dessert: do gelato properly

If you want a memorable cheap finish, do gelato like a crawl: try two or three in the same area and pick a winner.
