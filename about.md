## About this guide

*Florence Food & Drink: 101 Places, Specialties & Experiences* is a practical, opinionated guide to eating and drinking well in Florence, built from two decades of repeat visits, real habits, and a bias against wasting meals on tourist traps.

## About the author

I’ve lived in Florence for 20 years. For the past 15, I’ve taught Italian food history, which means I’ve spent a long time paying attention to the city’s food culture as it shifts, modernises, forgets things, reinvents them, and occasionally gets things exactly right.

I’m interested in both tradition and change: the old habits that still matter, and the new places that deserve space at the table. I’ve also benefited hugely from my students: their discoveries, their scepticism, their local knowledge, and the way they test Florence in real life. A lot of what works in this guide is thanks to them.
