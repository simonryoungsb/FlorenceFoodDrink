title: Gluten-Free in Florence (2026)
---

I’ve learned the hard way that **gluten-free in Florence** can mean three different things, depending on the kitchen and the risk of cross-contamination. This is the practical 2026 version: how to think about safety, what to ask, and a short starter list so you can eat well without gambling.

## The three tiers (how to think about safety)

**Tier 1 — Dedicated gluten-free (lowest risk):**  
Built to remove contamination risk.

**Tier 2 — Designed for celiacs (often workable):**  
Not always GF-only, but the menu and kitchen flow make gluten-free dining realistic.

**Tier 3 — “GF options” in shared kitchens (risk varies):**  
Sometimes okay for sensitivity; often not okay for celiac, depending on the kitchen.

## Two questions that actually matter

If you’re celiac, don’t ask only “is it gluten-free?” Ask:
1) **Do you have a separate prep area / separate equipment?**
2) **How do you prevent cross-contamination during service?** (shared fryers, flour in the air, shared tongs, etc.)

## A short starter list (from the book)

This is intentionally not exhaustive — it’s a starting point.

- **Quinoa** — dedicated gluten-free focus  
- **L’OV Osteria Vegetariana** — designed to work for celiacs/veg/vegan tables  
- **Risotteria Melotti** — naturally GF (rice-based)  
- **Giovanni Santarpia** — gluten-free pizza done seriously  
- **Pino’s Sandwiches** — gluten-free options  
- **Pasticceria Gualtieri** — strong GF range, separate GF lab noted  
- **Dolci e Dolcezze** — gluten-free cake option noted

## Bottom line

If you’re tired and hungry, choose Tier 1 or Tier 2. Florence is not the place to wing it.
