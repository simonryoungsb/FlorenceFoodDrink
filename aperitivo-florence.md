title: Aperitivo in Florence
---
I struggled for a while to understand **aperitivo in Florence** — it looks obvious until you try to do it well. This is the quick, usable version for **2026**: what aperitivo is, how to get it right, and a short starter list of places so you don’t waste an evening.

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GF8R2K7R) • [The 101 Index](/FlorenceFoodDrink/101/)

## What aperitivo is

Think of aperitivo as *pre-dinner drinking with intent*:
- you order a drink (wine, spritz, Negroni, Americano, etc.)
- you pair it with small bites (crostini, salumi, cheese, olives, little plates)
- you let the day resolve itself as the light go down

## How to do it well

**Pick the style:**
- classic wine-bar aperitivo (standing is normal)
- boards/cheese aperitivo (easy to turn into dinner)
- “beautiful setting” aperitivo (you’re paying for atmosphere)
- takeaway aperitivo (buy bottles + snacks and build your own)

**Timing helps.** If you want a seat, go a bit earlier; if you want atmosphere, go at peak.

This is a starter pack — the full list and details are in the book.
