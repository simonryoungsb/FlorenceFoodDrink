## What actually travels well

**Low-risk, high-reward**
- panforte / cantucci / biscotti / boxed sweets
- coffee
- honey, jams, spreads
- condiments and pantry “upgrades”
- dried pasta

**Bottles (worth it, but pack properly)**
Wine, amaros, digestivi — great gifts if you wrap them like you’re shipping glass (because you are).

## When to buy

- buy shelf-stable gifts early in the trip
- buy fragile/heat-sensitive treats on your last day
- in summer, be realistic about chocolate

## How to pack (quick rules)

- glass goes in the middle of the suitcase, wrapped in clothes, inside a second bag
- double-bag all liquids
- don’t pack a single bottle loose — cushion it so it can’t bounce

## Bringing wine home to the U.S. (3 sentences)

For U.S. travelers (21+), CBP generally allows **one liter of alcohol duty-free per person**; you can usually bring more if you **declare it** and pay any applicable duty/taxes (and state rules can add extra restrictions).  
For flying, TSA says beverages at **24% ABV or less (most wine)** aren’t subject to quantity limits in checked bags; higher-proof alcohol (24–70% ABV) is limited to **5 liters per passenger**.  
Declare honestly, pack defensively, and don’t assume the federal allowance overrides your destination state.

## A few reliable shopping stops (starter list)

- **Pegna dal 1860** — classic Florence gourmet shop energy  
- **Enoteca Alessi** — strong for pantry gifts (and good for a “shop + sip” stop)  
- **Mercato Centrale** — variety in one hit  
- **Savini Tartufi (Mercato Centrale)** — truffle gifts/kits  
- **La Sfoglia d’Oro** — pasta worth carrying home
